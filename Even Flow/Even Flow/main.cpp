 Description: This program takes in multiple data sets, where one data set is an input of the number of verices and the number of pipes connecting them followed by the designated vertics a pipe connects to from both ends and the capacity of it specific for all the pipes. When all the data sets have been input, two zeros with a space in between initiates the program run. The program then calculates and outputs  the smallest difference between the largest and smallest capacity of the best layout of minimal pipes such that every vertex is connected. If the input produces a layout where all junctions do not connect, the program outputs -1
